# FTS Ebola Scraper
This scraper (more a *wrapper*) was written to extract FTS figures from related to the Ebola crisis. The figures reflect exactly what is reported on [FTS website](http://fts.unocha.org/pageloader.aspx?page=emerg-emergencyDetails&emergID=16506), using a number of tests to make sure the figures are exact.

All indicators have a time series that dates to the beginning of when the response plan was issued (April 1, 2014). Those indicators can be used to undersatand how the contributions changed over time. There are possible application for the forecasting of donations.

The indicators included in this scraper are:

- Total Funding to the Emergency: Ebola Virus Outbreak (Pledges)
